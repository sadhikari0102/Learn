Just for playing around.
These are some dummy edits to be saved in the master branch.
This will help us in realizing the advantage of concept of branches in GitHub.
Cool stuff, haan !
This is an edit from the new branch. If you not down, you'll see this points system is pretty confusing.
Initially I thought that this will remain as is, but in the real file content the numbering is gone and all you are left with is lines merged together without any punctuation marks.
So I created this branch to add punctuation mark to the line and add some new ones. This way, I can learn the concept of branching, simultaneously fixing my ugly looking original content.
Wow! I already feel like Mark from Social Network. Just kidding, ami Sanjay!
